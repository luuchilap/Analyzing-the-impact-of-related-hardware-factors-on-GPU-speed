**Final MT2013 Project:** Analyzing the impact of related factors on GPU core speed

**1.	Multiple Linear Regression Model: describes how a multiple linear regression model is built to assess the factors affecting GPU core speed.**

   o	Model Building: details the steps involved in building the regression model.
   
   o	Hypothesis Testing: describes how the coefficients of the regression model are tested for significance.
   
   o	Model Improvement: describes how the regression model is improved, by removing insignificant terms or transforming variables.
   
   o	Model Comparison: describes how different regression models are compared.
   
   o	Checking Model Assumptions: describes how the assumptions of the linear regression model are verified.
   
   o	Speed Prediction: describes how the model is used to predict GPU core speed.
   

**2.	Multivariate ANOVA Model: describes how a multivariate ANOVA model is built to assess the influence of categorical variables on GPU core speed.**

  o	Model Building: details the steps involved in building the ANOVA model. 
  
  o	Analysis of Results: describes how the results of the ANOVA model are analyzed to identify statistically significant factors.
  
  o	Further ANOVA Analysis: describes how further analysis is conducted to explore the significant interactions between variables.
  
  o	Checking Model Assumptions: describes how the assumptions of the ANOVA model are verified.
